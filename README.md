## Testing Cascade Dropdowns

Using Angular2 Material Design,  ReactiveForms create a drop down of states that will cause a list of citys to filter.  I found this example
http://www.talkingdotnet.com/cascading-dropdown-select-list-using-angular-js-2/
but it is not using reactiveForms.    

When the screen loads there are no errors in the console.   The dropdown for states has a list of states.   When selecting a state this occurs...
Error in ./MainComponent class MainComponent - inline template:11:16 caused by: Cannot read property 'value' of undefined
